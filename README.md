# Network-topology-with-Mininet
Creating a simple network topology using network emulator Mininet and testing this with ONOS network controller. 
The project consisted of two parts:
I - Designing a network against the backdrop of Europe consisting of 10 switches, exploring network emulation using Mininet, and investigating traffic characteristics using the iperf generator (impact of parameters on traffic flow using TCP/UDP protocols and during mixed sessions).
II - Extending the network and writing a client application enabling the determination of the most optimal path for the desired connection and practical network control using the ONOS network controller.
